<p>Carbs: 1:2:1 ratio (C:H:O) (monosaccharide & polysaccharide) also table sugar C12H22O11 is also a carb, but it does not follow the rule. Can be broken down for chemical energy. Short term storage. Monomer – monosaccharides. Polymer – polysaccharide.</p> 

<p>Lipids: Glycerol head and fatty acid tails (fatty acids and triglycerides). It is long term storage and stores more than carbohydrates. Polymer – triglyceride. Special type: phospholipid.</p>
<p>Proteins: Carbon center connected to a hydrogen, carboxyl group (COOH), amino group(H2N), and R group (Amino acids and polypeptides). It has a lot of functions (enzyme, transport, signaling, etc.)</p>
<p>Nucleic Acids: Phosphate group, carbon ring, nitrogen base (DNA, RNA, ATP) (Nucleotides)

  <p>Enzymes work 2 ways, the lock and key and the Induced fit. </p>
<p>The lock and key method are when the substrate fits exactly in the enzyme activity zone, and it was the method that scientist's thought was the only one for many years. </p>
<p>Induced fit is the theory where the substrate changes to fit into the enzyme where it can bond. It was suggested by Daniel Koshland in 1958. </p>
<p>Water stuff:</p>
<p>•	cohesive behavior – Water molecules stick together.</p>
<p>•	ability to moderate temperature - Water has a high specific heat</p>
<p>•	expansion upon freezing - Water decreases in density after freezing</p>
<p>•	versatility as a solvent – Water is known as the universal solvent due to its polarity.</p>
<p>•	hydrogen bonding and polarity – Hydrogen bonds made between the hydrogen and the oxygen atoms in H2O the oxygen is slightly negative, and the hydrogens are slightly positive</p>

  <p>NOTES: 
<p>History of cell theory:</p>
<p>In 1665, Robert Hooke used a three-lens compound microscope and when examining tree cork found tiny hollow compartments which he named cells. </p>
<p>Around the same time, Anton van Leeuwenhoek made a single lens microscope as strong as the compound microscope. He became one of the first people to describe living cells when he observed single celled organisms in a pond of water.</p>
<p>As the microscope improved, it became easier to see greater magnification, making scientists wonder where cells come from.</p>
<p>German scientist Matthias Schleiden used a compound microscope and created the theory that plants were made of cells. When he worked with another scientist named Theodor Schwann, Schwann noticed similar structures in plant and animal cells. This made him publish the theory that all living things are made of cells which set the groundwork for later theories. But he thought cells form spontaneously while German scientist Rudolf Virchow proved him wrong saying all cells come from preexisting cells. </p>
<p>Cell Theory:</p>
<p>1.	All living things are made up of cells
<p>2.	Cells are the most basic unit of life
<p>3.	All cells come from pre-existing cells
<p>Structures of CELLS:

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>1-<b>Chloroplast</b>- Organelles that carry out photosynthesis. Outer and inner membrane, sacs are called thylakoids containing chlorophyll, a light absorbing molecule that gives it its green color and plays a key role in photosynthesis. This also has its own DNA and ribosomes and the same theory with mitochondria is also valid for this. Plants have both Mitochondria and Chloroplast.</p>
      <p>2-<b>Cell Wall</b>-Surrounds the cell membrane and forms a rigid layer that gives protection, support, and shape to the cell. Made of cellulose and polysaccharide in plants, chitin in fungi, and peptidoglycan in bacteria.</p></td>
    <td><p>1-<b>Cytoplasm</b>- Fluid that fills space between nucleus and cell membrane. Fluid portion is called cytosol and is mostly water.</p>
      <p>2-<b>Cytoskeleton</b> (Already talked about)</p>
    <p>3-<b>Vesicles</b>- Used to deliver materials from place to place. Short lived and recycled. Comes from ER and uses transport to Golgi from ER.</p>
    <p>4-<b>Nucleus</b>-Storage for genetic information or DNA. DNA contains genes that are instructions for making protein. Keeps materials that could damage DNA out of nucleus. Double membrane surrounding called nuclear envelope filled with pores allowing molecules to pass between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.</p>
    <p>5-<b>Nucleolus</b>-Dense region where tiny organelles that make proteins are made.</p>
    <p>6-<b>Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough and Smooth)</b>- Network of thin folded membranes. Maze of enclosed space where the inside is called the lumen. This makes proteins and lipids and all it is folded allows it to fit inside a cell. Surface with Ribosomes are called rough ER while the ones that do not and make lipids instead are called the smooth ER. </p>
    <p>7-<b>Ribosome</b>- Tiny organelles that link amino acids together to form proteins. At the site of protein synthesis and active participants of the process. Ribosomes are made of proteins and RNA. Pass through the nuclear pores into cytoplasm.</p>
    <p>8-<b>Centrosome</b>- Small region of cytoplasm that produces microtubules.</p>
    <p>9-<b>Cell Membrane</b>-Semi-Permeable layer that keeps things from coming in or out of a cell</p>
    <p>10-<b>Golgi Apparatus</b>-Closely layered stacks of membrane enclosed spaces that process, sort and deliver protein. </p>
    <p>11-<b>Mitochondria</b>-Supply energy for the cell. Bean shaped with two membranes using chemical reactions to convert the food you eat into energy. Have their own ribosomes and DNA. Suggested that they were originally free-living prokaryotes that were taken in by larger cells to help both survive.</p>
    <p>12-<b>Vacuole</b>-A fluid filled sac used for the storage of materials a cell needs. Most animal cells have small ones while large central ones are in plant ones. When a plant wilts, the leaves shrivel because there is not enough water in the vacuole to support the structure.</p></td>
    <td><p>1-<b>Centriole</b>-Found in the centrosome, these are cylinder shaped organelles made of short microtubules arranged in a circle and they help during cell division to pull apart the DNA. They can be found in some algae but not in plants. They also help organize microtubules to form cilia and flagella.</p>
    <p>2-<b>Lysosome</b>-Membrane bound organelles that contain enzymes. They defend cells from invading bacteria and viruses and break down damaged or worn-out cell parts. Some plant cells have them but fewer than in animal cells. They are formed in the rough ER inactive but when packaged and activated they need a membrane to keep them from destroying necessary things.</p></td>

  <p>Passive Transport:
<p>Passive transport can be through Osmosis or Diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of fluid or gas where places from high concentration to low concentration while Osmosis is the movement of water from high concentration to low concentration of water. There are 3 types of solutions isotonic, hypertonic, or hypotonic. Isotonic solutions occur when there is the same amount of a solute both in and outside of the cell. Hypotonic solutions are when there is less of a solute outside the cell, so water moves inside. The result is a bursting cell. Hypertonic is the opposite of hypotonic, in which water moves outside of the cell, causing it to shrivel. Molecules that have a hard time use facilitated diffusion using transport proteins to move certain molecules.</p>
<p>Active Transport:</p>
<p>There is active transport where it mostly uses chemical energy. There are two types, Endocytosis and Exocytosis. The first is the entering of chemicals into a cell while the second is the release of chemicals out of a cell. Part of endocytosis is phagocytosis and pinocytosis. Phagocytosis is engulfing solid material while pinocytosis is liquid. </p>

<p>Cellular Respiration: </p>

<p>C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H20 + energy </p>

<p>Steps: </p>

<p>Glycolysis -> In cytoplasm, anaerobic, separates glucose into 2 pyruvates (net yield: 2 pyruvate, 2 ATP and 2 NADH) </p>

<p>Pyruvate oxidation (intermediate step) -> Pyruvate transported into mitochondria, oxidized into acetyl CoA </p>

<p>Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) -> In the mitochondrial matrix, aerobic, inputs acetyl CoA and outputs 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, with CO2 as a byproduct. </p>

<p>Electron Transport Chain & Chemiosmosis-> In inner mitochondrial membrane, aerobic, Electrons are transferred from NADH and FADH2 into protein complexes in electron carriers. These are used to pump out protons through ATP synthase. This makes ATP. Water is a product </p>

<p>NET: 30-38 ATP </p>
 <p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/W3W34Hf/Picture9.png" alt="Picture9" border="0"></p>     
  <p>Fermentation: (when there is no oxygen available)
<p>Lactic Acid Fermentation: Occurs in muscle cells, makes 2 ATP and lactic acid as a byproduct, buildup of lactic acid causes your muscles to burn</p>
<p>Alcoholic fermentation: Occurs in some bacteria and yeast, makes 2 ATP and ethanol(alcohol) a byproduct.</p>
<p>Photosynthesis:</p>
<p>6CO2 + 6H20 -(light) → C6H12O6 + 6O2</p>
<p>Light reaction: Light splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen is released.</p>
<p>Dark reaction (Calvin Cycle): No light needed, Carbon dioxide is broken down, ATP is used to make glucose from the broken down C02 and hydrogens</p>
<p>Remember, the dark reaction occurs ALL throughout the day, not just in the absence of light. Both reactions are needed to produce glucose. </p>
<p>The energy of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is released when the link between the second and third phosphate groups is severed. The connection between the two is unstable and breaking it releases energy. When it breaks, it becomes adenosine diphosphate (ADP). ADP can become ATP again if the third phosphate group is added back. This means that the ADP is always recycled, and ATP is a temporary state.</p>

<p>Mitosis: </p>
<p>Interphase – PMAT - Cytokinesis</p>
<p>Interphase: G1, S, and G2 phases. In S phase, the DNA is duplicated.</p>
<p>Prophase: Chromosome's form, nucleus dissolves, centrioles move to poles, spindle fibers form</p>
<p>Metaphase: Chromosomes line up in the middle, Centromeres attach to the spindle fibers</p>
<p>Anaphase: Chromosomes are pulled apart and in the end cytokinesis begins. </p>
<p>Telophase: New nuclear membranes form, chromosomes uncoil, spindle fibers break down.</p>
<p>Cytokinesis: completes the cycle by dividing the two cells. Cleavage furrow in animal cells and cell plates in plant cells</p>

<p>Cancer</p>
<p>•	Mutation in the DNA when duplicating it can be harmful, though most of the mutations are minor and most mutated cells are killed by the body’s immune system. Some do not become cancer cells. Cancer cells duplicate unrestrictedly and therefore faster than regular cells which means that they are dangerous. </p>
<p>•	Benign tumors = mostly good, does not spread and invade organs</p>
<p>•	Malignant tumors = Bad, spreads and invades organs and stuff</p>
<p>•	Carcinogens- anything that causes cancer; Ex. Viruses (15% of all human cancers), UV radiation (leading cause of skin cancer), chemicals (such as ones in food; cooking foods at elevated temperatures)</p>
<p>•	Cancer is dangerous because it makes the body give nutrients to it without providing anything back to said body.</p>
<p>Mutations that lead to cancer usually occur in genes that control the cell cycle. These include tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes.</p>
<p>1.	Tumor-suppressor genes normally prevent cells with damaged DNA from dividing. Mutations in these genes prevent them from functioning normally. As a result, cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide. Proto-oncogenes normally help control cell division. Mutations in these genes turn them into oncogenes. Oncogenes promote the division of cells with damaged DNA.</p>

      <p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Nervous system: CNS (central) and PNS</p>
<p>The nervous system consists of 2 parts. The Central Nervous System and the Peripheral nervous system.</p>
<p>Central: Brain, Spinal cord, receives, interprets, and sends signals to the PNS</p>
<p>Peripheral: Network of nerves that connect the CNS to the organs, uses sensory and motor neurons to detect stimuli and signal organs and muscles to act/react.</p>
<p>Cerebrum: The 4 lobes of brain, interpret signals from the body, right controls left and left controls right, outer layer is the cerebral cortex</p>
<p>Cerebellum: That thing that looks like a ball of yarn, coordinates movements</p>
<p>Brain Stem: involuntary actions, mid brain=reflexes, pons=breathing, passes signals from spinal cord, medulla oblongata=controls life-sustaining heart functions, vomiting, swallowing, and coughing.</p>
<p>Identifying them:</p>
     <p> Midbrain – The part above pons</p>
<p>Pons – The bulge part in the brain stem, like an Adams apple in the neck, breathing</p>
<p>Medulla oblongata – Part below the brain, controls heart rate</p>
<p>Spinal Cord: Rope-like bundle of neurons, receives signals and sends them to the brain, reflex arcs (self-explanatory)  </p> 
<p>PNS contains motor and sensory system</p>
<p>Motor: Triggers voluntary and involuntary responses</p>
<p>Sensory: Collects info</p>
<p>Somatic: division that controls voluntary movements “talks to PNS”</p>
<p>Autonomic: division that controls involuntary movements, sympathetic “fight or flight” thing prepares body for stress and action, parasympathetic turns it off (normal stuff happens)</p>
<p>Brain:</p>
<p>Frontal Lobe: reasoning, motor skills, higher level cognition, and expressive (thinking and stuff) language. 	</p>
<p>Parietal Lobe: processing tactile sensory information such as pressure, touch, and pain (sensory)</p>

      <p>Occipital Lobe: interpreting visual stimuli and information (seeing)</p>
      <p style="color:red;">Eyes on the back of your head</p>
      <p>Temporal Lobe: memory, speech perception, and language (memory)</p>

      <u><p>Cardiovascular system: main transport system of mammals</p></u>
      <p>Left side of heart- oxygenated blood coming in from lungs 
<p style="color:green;">Comes in from pulmonary veins > left atrium > mitral valve > left ventricle > atrial valve > aorta > other parts of body  </p>
<p>Right side of heart- deoxygenated blood comes in heart</p>
<p style="color:green;">Comes in from superior and inferior vena cava > right atrium > tricuspid valve > right ventricle > pulmonary valve > pulmonary artery > lungs</p>
<p>Pathways of blood:</p>
<p>Blood has two different paths that meet at the heart. These are called pulmonary and systemic circulation. All blood travels on both paths. </p>
<p>Pulmonary Circulation- Occurs between the heart and lungs and main function is to carry oxygen poor blood to the lung and pick up the O2 to carry back to the heart. </p>
<p>Systemic Circulation- Between the heart and the rest of the body to carry oxygen to all the cells and transport poor blood back to the heart. In extreme conditions, the systems can serve vital functions in making sure the vital organs stay at a constant temperature. </p>

</table>
      
      <p>Plasma- mostly water/has glucose, amino acids, salts, hormones, blood proteins, and antibodies</p>
<p>Red Blood Cells- made in bone marrow, main function: carry oxygen, contains hemoglobin (pigment that contains iron and attaches to oxygen), broken down by liver, spleen, and bone marrow</p>
<p>Platelets- small fragments of cells with no nucleus, made in bone marrow, aids in blood clotting</p>

<p>Factors affecting blood flow:</p>
<p>Blood pressure: Increased blood pressure = increased blood flow = smaller blood vessels      Decreased blood pressure = decreased blood flow = larger blood vessels</p>
<p>Blood pressure is the force the blood pushes against the wall and a healthy pressure for a resting young adult is 120 over 70 millimeters of mercury. 120 is known as the systolic pressure which is the amount of pressure on the artery walls when the left ventricle contracts. 70 is known as diastolic pressure which is the pressure in the artery when the left ventricle relaxes. These changes are based on the elastic and unblocked arteries and the strength of the heart. The less elastic and more blockage the harder the blood flow and harder the heart pumps raising blood pressure. Stress and strong emotions can also make it rise but it drops with rest. Permanent high pressure is called hypertension which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. A stroke is where the blood flow to the brain is interrupted, and a heart attack is where the arteries are damaged or blocked.</p> 
<p>Lifestyle affects it since smoking, lack of exercise, excessive weight, and long-term stress, and a diet low in fruits and veggies and high in saturated fats increase the risk of circulatory diseases. Diseases affect the heart. To reduce the risk physicians, urge people to not smoke, remain a healthy weight, and exercise regularly. </p>


<p>Blood volume: Usually varies little, Increased volume = increased flow, decreased volume = decreased flow</p>
<p>Resistance: Increased thickness/viscosity = increased resistance = decreased blood flow           Decreased thickness/viscosity = decreased resistance = increased blood flow.</p>
<p> Exercise: Increased exercise = widened blood vessels =increased blood flow</p>
<p>•	Disease: see below</p>
<p>o	Atherosclerosis: Where plaque builds up in your arteries, casing decreased blood flow = increased blood pressure, cause heart attack, stroke, or death, thickening and hardening of the walls of the arteries</p>
<p>o	Polycythemia Vera: Rare disease that makes your body make too many red blood cells, thicker blood, more blood clots, cause heart attack or stroke</p>
<p>o	High Salt intake: Increased volume of water in the red blood cells, increasing the total amount of blood in the blood vessels, increased blood pressure, speeds up buildup of plaque in blood vessels, may injure blood vessels, tires out heart by making it work harder</p>
<p>o	Heart Disease: Coronary artery disease (CAD) happens when the arteries become hardened and narrowed due to atherosclerosis. This causes less blood to flow, which can cause heart attack</p>
<p>Immune System:</p>
<p>The immune system protects the body from invading pathogens</p>
<p>Non-specific immune system:</p>
<p>1st line of defense: Skin and Mucous membranes</p>
<p>2nd line of defense: White blood cells</p>
<p>Mast and Basophil cause inflammation from histamine </p>
<p>Neutrophil = phagocyte (engulfs invading cells) virus, bacteria, fungus 	</p>
<p>Macrophage = phagocyte (engulfs damaged body cells and virus, bacteria, fungi) called a monocyte when in blood...enters tissue and becomes macrophage. </p>
<p>Lymphocyte = </p>
<p>o T cells = disintegrates infected cells </p>
<p>o B cells = makes inactivation proteins/antibodies and inactivates pathogens that have not yet reached healthy cells.</p>
<p>Eosinophil = injects poisonous “packets” into parasites</p>
<p>B cells:</p>
<p>•	Normal B cells act as APCs</p>
<p>•	Plasma B cell- creates antibodies</p>
<p>•	Memory B cell- long living cell that protects and monitors from the same pathogen</p>
<p>Types of T cells: killer (cytotoxic) T cell, helper T and memory T</p>
<p>1.	Memory T cells – Remains long term after the infection happened. Can turn into effector T cells if the same pathogen enters the body again</p>
<p>2.	Effector T cells – T cells that are trained to search for a specific antigen and cause the cells with the antigen to perform apoptosis.</p>
<p>3.	Helper T cells- aid B cells in production of antibodies and help killer T cells, work in the lymph nodes and site of infection</p>
<p>Uses - </p>
<p>Antibodies: Inactivates pathogen, clumps pathogens, activates complement proteins </p>
<p>Complement proteins: weaken pathogen’s cell membrane (lyses the cell), attract phagocytes, trap microbes to blood vessel walls</p>
<p>Interferons: Warns neighboring cells of the virus, causes infected cells to perform apoptosis, activates immune cells</p>
<p>Specific immune system:</p>
<p>3rd line of defense: Antibodies are made to match a specific antigen invading the body. </p>
<p>Passive Immunity: mechanisms existed before infection, passed between generations, genetic </p>
<p>Active Immunity: occurs after the pathogen has bypassed the 1st line of defense includes </p>
<p>Acquired Immunity which is a resistance developed after initial exposure.</p>
<p>Antibiotics kill bacteria and fungi, risk of resistance if used often.</p>
<p>Vaccines allow production of memory cells by giving exposure without sickness, usually a disabled pathogen or the antigen. </p>
<p>Types:</p>
<p>•	Dead viruses or bacteria </p>
<p>•	Live attenuated (weakened living pathogen) </p>
<p>•	Component (use components or parts of the pathogen...e.g., protein coat of a virus) </p>
<p>•	Toxoid (inactivated bacteria toxins)</p>
<p>Ways of transmission: Airborne, droplets, skin contact</p>
<p>More info:</p>
<p>•	Autoimmune disease- condition where one’s immune system attacks one’s own tissues</p>
<p>•	Innate immunity- generalized immune response; nonspecific</p>
<p>•	Adaptive immunity- antigen specific response; memory</p>
<p>•	Barrier immunity (first line of defense) is part of innate immunity</p>
<p>•	Types of barriers: mechanical barriers (physically block pathogens from entering, ex. skin and mucus membranes), biological barriers (living organisms that help protect the body’s linings, ex. harmless bacteria on the skin’s exterior) and chemical barriers (enzymes that kill pathogens, ex. sweat, mucus, stomach acid (hydrochloric acid), saliva & tears)</p>
<p>•	B cells are produced in the bone marrow</p>
<p>•	T cells are produced in the thymus</p>
<p>•	Nonspecific defense- keeps out any type of microbe</p>
<p>•	Specific defense- attacks a specific microbe one type at a time</p>
<p>•	Inflammation- chemicals released by damaged tissues; increased blood flow, phagocytic white blood cells arrive</p>

<p>•	Bacteria- single celled organisms without a nucleus (Ex. E coli)</p>
<p>•	Viruses- nonliving particles that take over living cells (Ex. Coronavirus)</p>
<p>•	Protozoa- single celled organisms with a nucleus (Ex. Giardia lamblia)</p>
<p>•	Fungi- simple organisms including mushrooms and yeasts that grow as single cells or thread like filaments (Ex. Death cap mushroom)</p>

<p>2.	Pathogens</p>
<p>3.	Pollutants and poisons</p>
<p>4.	Organ malfunction</p>

      <p>How Eggs are developed:</p>
	<p>The eggs, produced before a female is born, are produced inside the ovaries. When a female baby is born, she already has 2 million potential egg cells. After puberty, which is triggered by a hormone called Estrogen, which is produced in the ovaries, each month an egg would mature and travel through the fallopian tube. Since the egg is slow traveling, it takes several days to travel down the fallopian tube. </p>
<p>How Sperms are developed:</p>
	<p>For males, puberty is the time sperms are produced. Each testis contains hundreds of tiny tubules where millions of sperm cells are produced. Unlike females, males continue to produce sperm for the rest of their life. </p>
<p>Fetal development:</p>
<p style="color:blue;">Fertilization (zygote)-cell division-blastocyst-embryo-fetus (order)</p>
<p>After the egg cell is fertilized, it becomes a zygote, which undergoes mitotic division as it travels to the uterus. Once it becomes a blastocyst (a hollow ball of cells) and implants itself on the uterine lining. Once differentiation begins, the zygote becomes an embryo. </p>
<p>Maternal and fetal blood do not mix.</p>
<p>Amniotic Sac: fluid filled and cushions embryo...prevents sudden temperature changes. </p>
<p>Chorion membrane: nourishes embryo and has villi that extends into uterine lining </p>
<p>Placenta: connection to maternal blood...oxygen, nutrients, and waste. </p>
<p>Umbilical cord: 2 arteries + 1 vein, fetal blood supply.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9nMkrmG/Picture17.png" alt="Picture17" border="0"></p>
      <p>38 weeks (about 8 and a half months) of development from zygote to fully formed fetus. </p>
<p>This is split up into 3 trimesters (~3 months each).</p>
<p>1st Trimester: Heartbeat in 5 weeks, vertebrae and spinal cord begin developing, arms legs and fingers start forming, now called fetus, main organs start to form at this stage. (Placenta and umbilical cord also develop) </p>
<p>2nd Trimester: Heartbeat heard via stethoscope, Brain grows fast, mother can feal movement, fingers and toes fully develop, swallows' amniotic fluid, and makes urine</p>
<p>3rd Trimester: Lungs fully developed, grows to largest size – 7-9 pounds, bones grow and harden, eyes open when awake and closed when asleep. Babies born prematurely at the start of the third have a hard time surviving while babies born toward the middle to end often survive and thrive. At the last month, the lungs are strengthened and the fetus sucks in and pushes out of the amniotic fluid. (Water breaks, child breathing)</p>

	<b><u><p>DNA replication:</p></u></b>
<p>•	Helicase unzips the DNA by breaking the fragile hydrogen bonds, creating a replication fork.</p>
<p>•	DNA primase tells the DNA polymerase where to start and it starts connecting complementary nucleotides together. It goes in a 5’(phosphate) to 3’(carbon), so there will be a lagging strand as shown below.</p>
<p>•	Ligase glues together the Okazaki fragments and two new identical strands of DNA are created. This is known as semi-conservative because each new strand has half of the old strand of DNA in it.</p>

<b><u><p>Transcription:</p></u></b>
<p>•	A section of DNA is unzipped, and RNA polymerase identifies where to start.</p>
<p>•	RNA polymerase, going in the 5’ to 3’ direction, and pairs the bases, replacing thymine with uracil.</p>
<p>•	Once the entire gene is transcribed, the RNA strand detaches from the DNA and the DNA is zipped back together.</p>
<b><u><p>Translation:</p></u></b>
<p>1.	mRNA enters the ribosomes, and the exposed codon (a triplet of bases) attracts a complementary tRNA.</p>
<p>2.	The ribosome makes a peptide bond between the amino acids and one tRNA goes away.</p>
<p>3.	This repeats until it reaches a stop codon.</p>

<b><u><p>Parts of plant:</p></u></b>
<p>Roots: Gets water and anchors the plant to the ground</p>
<p>Stem: Supports the plant and transports water and nutrients throughout the plant.</p>
<p>Leaf: Performs photosynthesis to make food </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/4sd7JM0/Picture25.png" alt="Picture25" border="0"></p>    
<p>Cuticle – Protects the plant from the elements. Radiation, drought, injury. Limits evaporation and forms water resistant covering.</p> 
<p>Epidermis – Protects the leaf from water loss. Adds an extra layer of protection. The lower epidermis contains stomata.</p> 
<p>Palisade Cells – Where photosynthesis occurs. Absorbs the light that enters the leaf</p> 
<p>Phloem – Transports food made in the leaves to other parts of the plant. It is a vascular tissue</p> 
<p>Spongy Cells – Allows for interchange of gases that are needed during photosynthesis. It is loosely packed, creating air spaces that allow gas diffusion.</p> 
<p>Stomata – Takes in carbon dioxide and releases oxygen</p> 
<p>Guard Cells – Regulates the opening and closing of stomates. Environmental factors play a role in this.</p> 
<p>Xylem – Transports water from the roots to the leaves. It is a vascular tissue</p> 
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/F6xTShs/Picture26.png" alt="Picture26" border="0"></p>
<p>Anther – Produces Pollen</p>
<p>Pollen grains – Contain gametes needed for fertilization</p>
<p>Filament – Holds the anther up</p>
<p>Ovary – Contains and protects the ovules until they are fertilized</p>
<p>Ovules – Forms seeds after being fertilized.</p>
<p>Petals – Used to attract pollinators. Attracts insects and small animals. Not all flowering plants have brightly colored petals. If the petals of these flowers are reduced or absent, then the plant relies on wind or water for pollination</p>
<p>Sepal – Encloses and protects the developing reproductive structures. Leaf like structures that surround and protect the flower before it blooms. </p>
<p>Receptacle – Part where the flower starts to grow. Part of the branch where the flower forms.</p>
<p>Stigma – Catches pollen to enter the ovary. Is often sticky</p>
<p>Carpels – Female reproductive structures</p>
<p>Pistil – Carpels are fused together to form a pistil. It has three parts: Stigma, style, and ovary</p>
<p>Style – Long tube that attaches the stigma to the ovary</p>
<p>Stamen – Male reproductive structures. Contains two parts: Anther and filament</p>
<p>Fruit – Any structure that encloses and protects a seed. </p>
	<b><p>PLANT REPRODUCTION:</p></b>
<p>A key feature of all plant life cycles is alternation of generations.</p>
<p>Sporophyte: A multicellular diploid (2n) stage. “Spore plant,” meaning a plant that will make spores.</p>
<p>Gametophyte: A multicellular haploid (n) stage. “Gamete plant,” meaning a plant that will make gametes that will eventually fuse to form a zygote. </p>
<p>Gametes (sex cells = egg and sperm) are produced from haploid gametophyte during mitosis. </p>
<p>Meiosis produces spores that will develop into haploid multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>Alternation of Generations: </p>
<p>It happens in every multicellular organism</p>
<p>Basically, describes the process between haploid and diploid cells.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xDry4ny/Picture27.png" alt="Picture27" border="0"></p>
<b><u><p>NONVASCULAR REPRODUCTION:</b></u></p>
<p>Gametophyte dominated</p>
<p>Water carries sperm from a male gametophyte to a female gametophyte to facilitate fertilization</p>
<p>After, when the sporophyte forms from mitosis, it remains attached to the gametophyte, relying on it for water and nutrients</p>
<p>Once spores are made, they are dispersed via water (or air if the humidity is high enough) and germinate to yield more gametophytes, and the cycle continues</p>
<b><u><p>VASCULAR REPRODUCTION:</b></u></p>
	<u><p>Seedless:</u></p>
<p>Reproduce most similarly to nonvascular plants</p>
<p>Sporophyte dominated</p>
<p>Spores made by the sporophyte grow on the underside of a fern’s leaf and get released to find a moist patch of ground to germinate on</p>
<p>These spores create a tiny gametophyte from mitoses and has male and female reproductive organs on the underside of the leaf</p>
<p>Sperm on one side finds an egg on the other side and fuse to form the zygote, which develops into the sporophyte.</p>
<u><p>Gymnosperms:</p></u>
<p>Sporophyte dominated</p>
<p>Cones and pollen are key reproductive structures</p>
<p>Pollen grains carry sperm from male cones at the bottom of the upward to fertilize eggs in ovules in the female cones towards the top of the tree</p>
<p>After fertilization, a “naked” seed grows, which will later ripen into a mature plant</p>
<p>Seed provides key nutrients and protection for the growing plant</p>
<p>Pollen gets dispersed by wind and does not need water to reproduce</p>
	<u><p>Angiosperms:</p></u>
<p>Sexual reproduction in angiosperms occur when the pollen from an anther is transferred to the stigma. The pollen moves down the style of the pistil into the ovary. It then fertilizes an ovule, which then develops into a seed. </p>
<p>Sporophyte dominated – Every part of the plant is the sporophyte except for the pollen and ovum in the flower</p>
<p>Flower is the key reproductive structure</p>
<p>Does not need wind or water, pollination strategies are used to attract other organisms to spread pollen to other ovules</p>
<p>After fertilization, the ovule becomes seed, and the ovule becomes fruit (anything the ovary turns into even nuts)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/YcZfxpk/Picture28.png" alt="Picture28" border="0"></p>
<p><b><u>POLLINATION: </u></b></p>
<p>Pollination is when water, wind, or an organism carries pollen from one plant to another to make fertilization possible</p>
<p>Fertilization leads to seed development, which leads to fruit development (and thus seed dispersal) in flowering plants</p>
<p>Angiosperms have unique adaptations to allow them to use a variety of pollination strategies in their specific environments</p> 
<p>Self-Pollination: Plant pollinates itself. Produces smaller and lesser amounts of seeds, no genetic diversity</p>
<p>Cross-Pollination: Requires pollinators (or wind or water). Produces more seeds and healthier offspring. Genetically diverse. In many flowers, the pistils and stamens reach maturity at different times. This prevents the plant from pollinating itself, forcing itself to get pollinated by another plant</p>
<p>Flowering plants: Relies on insects or animals to pollinate. Produces large colorful flowers.</p>
<p>Non-flowering plants: Relies on wind or water to pollinate</p>
<p>Seed dispersal is the movement of seeds away from the parent plant</p>
<p>Plants utilize a variety of different methods to do this</p>
<p>Advantages of using seed and fruit dispersal: Makes the offspring grow farther from the parent plant to reduce competition between them both.</p>
<p><b><u>PLANT ORGAN FUNCTIONS:</u></b></p>
<p>It is thought that plants have evolved from aquatic algae. The earliest land plants had spores only. </p>
<p>Then vascular plants appeared next. They evolved leaf, stem, root, and vascular structures to become more competitive.</p>
<p>Fruit: Advanced seed dispersal</p>
<p>Flower: Showy display and scent to attract pollination. Attaches to the stem of the plant. Are brightly colored to attract organisms to pollinate the plant. </p>
<p>Cone: Protection for seeds. Allows seeds to be protected by tough tissues until they are mature enough to be dispersed.</p>
<p>Seed: Packaged genetic material for generating a plant somewhere else; delayed growth. Over spores, seeds have the advantages of delayed growth of the new baby plant, greater protection from the environment, and the ability to be dispersed over great distances.</p>
<p>Root: Improved mineral and water uptake. Keeps the plants anchored and absorbs water and nutrients. The center of root is vascular cylinder, which is made of xylem and phloem tissues. Surrounded by ground tissue, covered by dermal tissue. These cells have tiny protections called root hairs, making their way between soil particles, increasing the surface area. Root caps are a small cone of cells that protect the growing part of the root. Behind the root cap is where most of the root’s growth occurs. Groups of cells that are the source of new cells form tissue called meristem. The types of roots are fibrous root systems and taproot systems. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/DKb7d7s/Picture29.png" alt="Picture29" border="0"></p>
<p>Stem: Improved support and water transport. Transports nutrients, stores nutrients, and creates new growth using special cells. Pattern of plant growth depends on the location of meristems in the plant. Stems have two growths. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/BgJ2vNM/Picture30.png" alt="Picture30" border="0"></p>	    
<p>Leaf: Greater surface area for photosynthesis. Collects sunlight in chloroplasts, photosynthesis, and contains stomata for gas exchange. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/6r7cYHk/Picture31.png" alt="Picture31" border="0"></p>
<u><b><p>PLANT CELL TYPES:</p></b></u>
<p>Plant tissues are made up of three basic cell types.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/WcM0Z55/Picture32.png" alt="Picture32" border="0"></p>
<p>Parenchyma Cells: Most common type. Least specialized plant cells but can divide for the entirety of their lives. Are important to healing and regeneration. Stores starch, oils, and water for plants. It has thin walls and large water filled vacuoles. Photosynthesis occurs in green chloroplasts within parenchyma cells in leaves. Chloroplasts and colorless plastids within roots and stems store starch. </p>
<p>Collenchyma Cells: Has cell walls that range from thick to thin, providing support for while still allowing plant to grow. Most common in younger tissues of leaves and shoots. Are flexible. It doesn’t contain lignin in cell wall, so they can stretch and change size. </p>
<p>Sclerenchyma Cells: Strongest plant cell. It has a second cell wall that’s hardened by lignin. Can’t grow within plants. Most die when they reach maturity. Cytoplasm and organelles disintegrate when they die, but the rigid cell walls are left behind as skeletal support. Found in stems and leaf veins. </p>
<u><b><p>TISSUE SYSTEMS AND FUNCTIONS:</p></b></u>
<p>Ground tissue system: Support, storage, and photosynthesis. Used for metabolism. Any tissue that is not dermal or vascular. Types of this tissue include Parenchyma (traditional plant cells), Collenchyma (support, like cellulose), and Sclerenchyma (wooded and durable, like what makes up an apple core). Parenchyma tissue is the most common of the ground tissues. Makes up inside of a plant. </p>
<p>Dermal tissue system: Protection, water loss prevention. Includes epidermis (mostly) and periderm (like bark). Made up of live parenchyma cells. On leaves and some stems, epidermal cells may secrete a wax-coated substance that becomes the cuticle. Dermal tissue made of dead parenchyma cells makes up the outer bark of woody plants. </p>
<p>Vascular tissue system: Support, water, and nutrient transport. Xylem transports water from the roots to the shoot. Phloem moves minerals from roots to the shoots and moves sugars made during photosynthesis from leaves in from the shoot to other parts of the plant. </p>
<p>Ground, vascular, and dermal tissue all occur in roots, stems, and leaves.</p>
<u><b><p>Vascular vs non-Vascular:</p></b></u>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1LtD131/Picture33.png" alt="Picture33" border="0"></p>
<p>Non-Vascular plants: No Vascular tissue, smaller, no leaves stems roots, water is absorbed via osmosis, has a thallus body (lacks roots and stem) and a root like structure:</p>
<p>1.	Moss</p>
<p>a.	Small, dense, looks like carpet, lives in any biome, helps prevent erosion</p>
<p>2.	Liverworts</p>
<p>a.	Have liver shaped lobes, prefer tropical biome, like dim light and damp soil, do not have stomata (but others do)</p>
<p>3.	Hornworts</p>
<p>a.	Have horn shaped structures, prefer tropical biome, only have 1 chloroplast</p>
<p>Vascular plants: Contain vascular tissue (xylem and phloem), have organs such as root stems and leaves, 3 types of tissue dermal vascular and ground (as shown in the image below), 3 organs roots Stem Leaves (discussed in the beginning I believe)</p>
<p>•	Angiosperms</p>
<p>o	Angiosperms is a type of vascular plant. It has seeds that are enclosed in an ovary. They rely on organisms for seed dispersal. Angiosperms are flowering plants, with flowers as their reproductive structure.</p>
<p>o	Have seeds, flowering, normal flowering plant stuff, animals for seed dispersal</p>
<p>	Monocots</p>
<p>•	1 seed leaf (cotyledon) in the seed embryo, parallel leaf veins, flower petals in multiples of 3, net like root system</p>
<p>	Dicots</p>
<p>•	2 cotyledons in the seed embryo, branching leaf veins, flower petals in multiples of 4 or 5, tap root system</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7tGY944/Picture34.png" alt="Picture34" border="0"></p>
<p>•	Gymnosperms</p>
<p>o	Have seeds, no flower or fruit, use cones, wind as seed dispersal</p>
<p>•	Seedless</p>
<p>o	No seeds reproduce similarly to nonvascular plants using spores, dispersal via water</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9pjFhFB/Picture35.png" alt="Picture35" border="0"></p>
<p>Ground tissue – metabolism, storage, and support</p>
<p>•	Parenchyma: Traditional plant cells</p>
<p>•	Collenchyma: Support</p>
<p>•	Sclerenchyma: wooded and durable (stuff that makes apple core)</p>

<p>Dermal tissue – used for protection and to prevent water loss</p>
<p>1.	Epidermis and periderm (bark)</p>
<p>2.	Cuticle is a waxy layer</p>
<u><b><p>COHESION-TENSION THEORY:</p></b></u>
<p>A theory that explains water movement. Cohesion and adhesion create tension within the xylem that helps move the water upwards. </p>

<b><p>Pedigrees: (that thing for pets, right? -Daniel)</p></b>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/w6FnyMG/l3.png" alt="l3" border="0"></p>
<p>Parts: </p>

<p>Male – Box </p>

<p>Female – Circle </p>

<p>Affected – Shaded </p>

<p>Mated – Horizontal line </p>

<p>Offspring – Vertical line </p>

<p>Generation – Roman numerals  </p>

<p>Age order is from left to right and number from 1 and up, with the oldest being the lowest number. </p>

<p>To find out the genotypes of the person, find two parents that either are both shaded, or both clear that has a child that is the opposite and then label the child rr. Then call the parents Rr and continue from there. There might be times where the genotype is partially unknown and in that case, you can do R? To represent that you aren’t sure what the genotype is.  </p>

<u><p>Autosomal Recessive: </p></u>

<p>Most common pattern, disease is rare and skips generations, males and females are equally likely to inherit the disease </p>

<p>Only shows with two recessive alleles (ex. rr) </p>

<p>Carriers are heterozygous (ex. Rr) </p>

<p>25% for two carriers to have a child with the trait </p>

<u><p>Autosomal Dominant: </p></u>

<p>The disease is common in the family, never skips a generation, and males and females are equally likely to inherit the disease. Very ineffective though as the person who has the disease might pass away before passing on the disease. </p>

<p>Less common due to being eliminated by natural selection </p>

<p>People can’t really be a carrier because if they had a dominant trait then they’ll be affected. </p>

<p>Trait/disease is expressed if the person is homozygous dominant or heterozygous (ex. RR, Rr) </p>

<u><p>Autosomal Chromosome Disorders: </p></u>

<p>Autosomal chromosome disorders are caused by a mutation happening to an autosomal chromosome and thus it ends up affecting multiple genes. There are many types of mutations that can cause an autosomal chromosome disorder. </p>

<p>Nondisjunction is one of the most common types of causes for autosomal chromosome disorders 

<p>Nondisjunction is the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate correctly during meiosis, resulting in an abnormal number of chromosomes in the resulting gametes </p>

<p>Happens during anaphase </p>

<p>Ex. 3 chromosomes instead of 2; 1 chromosome instead of 2 </p>

<p>23 pairs of chromosomes (46 chromosomes) in a normal person </p>

<u><p>Sex Chromosome Disorders: </p></u>

<p>Sex chromosome disorders are caused by a mutation happening specifically to a sex chromosome. Typically, the mutation is nondisjunction, and results in an organism having an abnormal number of sex chromosomes. (ex. XXY and XXXY) </p>

<p>A person with Turner’s syndrome only inherits one X chromosome.  </p>

<p>They are biologically female rather than male because they only have one X chromosome. Usually applies to girls missing one X chromosome. They don’t contain a Y chromosome, meaning that they miss out on all the traits that make up a male. </p> 

<p>Not inherited because it happens randomly based on how a girl’s genes are first formed. </p>

<p>People with Klinefelter’s syndrome inherit extra X chromosomes, and can have genotypes like XXY and XXXY. </p> 

<p>Sex(X)-Linked Recessive: </p>

<p>Disease is rare, often skips generations, males are often more affected than females, affected fathers never pass the disease to their sons </p>

</p>
<p>Vestigial Organ – Organ that is left over from a previous ancestor that isn’t used anymore.  
</p>
<p>Bottleneck effect – A bottleneck incident causes only a small fraction of the population to exist, causing the genetic diversity to be lower in future populations.  
</p>

</p>
<p>Gene pool – The collection of different genes in an interbreeding population.  
</p>

</p>
<p>Fitness – How well an organism is adapted to its environment  
</p>
<p>Polygenic trait – Traits that are influenced by more than one gene  
</p>
<p>Speciation – The creation of a new species from a pre-existing one.  
</p>
<p>Adaptation – The process of changing an organism's traits to better suit the environment  
</p>
<p>Directional Selection - Increases the expression of an extreme version of a trait in a population  
</p>
<p>Reproductive Isolation – The inability of species to breed  
</p>
<p>Survival of the Fittest – Organisms most fit to their environment will live longer and reproduce.  
</p>
<p>Stabilizing Selection - Eliminates the extreme versions of the trait because the average version leads to more fitness  
</p>
<p>Behavioral selection – An organism starts behaving differently, which causes it to be unable to mate with any other organisms of the same species.  
</p>
<p>Natural selection – The process where organisms most fit survive and reproduce. This leads to more organisms over time developing beneficial traits.  
</p>
<p>Disruptive Selection - Splits a population into two groups, removes the ones with average traits and favors the two extremes.  
</p>
<p>Geographic selection – The geography separates two groups of the same species and eventually they become different species.  
</p>
<p>Descent with modification – The offspring's genetics are randomly changed a tiny bit.  
</p>
<p>Genetic Drift – A random change in the gene pool that causes a disruption.  
</p>
<p>Temporal Isolation – When two or more species reproduce at different times. 
</p>
<p>Microevolution – Evolution that happens to a small population 
</p>
<p>Macroevolution – Evolution that happens to large populations 
</p>
<u><b><p>Important Peeps: 
		</p></b></u>
<p>Charles Darwin – Developed the theory of natural selection 
</p>
<p>Hutton – Stated that geologic features must have taken a long time to form 
</p>
<p>Lyell – Wrote "Principles of Geology" 
</p>
<p>Lamarck – Believed that body parts will become larger or smaller due to use or disuse. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/WGY2W7b/f.png" alt="f" border="0"></p>
<p>Malthus – Stated that the human population is growing faster than its food supply</p>
		<u><b><p>Principles of Natural Selection:</p></b></u>
<p>Overproduction of Offspring – Lots of offspring and limited resources causes competition for those resources.</p>
<p>Variation – Differences in the traits of organisms, Sources: Random mutations and crossing over in mitosis</p>
<p>Adaptation – A feature that allows an organism to better survive in its environment, these adaptations will become more common overtime because the organisms with it live longer and will be able to reproduce, this also changes the gene pool</p>
<p>Descent with Modification – A change in the gene frequency overtime</p>
		<b><p>Individuals don’t evolve, populations do!</p></b>
		<u><b><p>Distribution of traits:</p></b></u>
<p>Normal distribution is a bell curve</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/hMysckT/g.png" alt="g" border="0"></p>
		<p>(Red is the original one) </p>
<p>Directional Selection - Increases the expression of an extreme version of a trait in a population</p>
<p>Stabilizing Selection - Eliminates the extreme versions of the trait because the average version leads to more fitness</p>
<p>Directional Selection - Increases the expression of an extreme version of a trait in a population</p>
<p>Allele frequency – How common an allele is in a population</p>
<p>Formula:</p>
<p>P = frequency of dominant allele</p>
<p>Q = frequency of the recessive allele</p>
<p>P + q = 1</p>
		<u><b><p>MECHANISMS OF MICROEVOLUTION:</p></b></u>
<p>Mutations – Any change in the DNA of an organism</p>
<p>Natural Selection – Organisms more fit for their environments will survive and reproduce more offspring</p>
<p>Genetic Drift – Random change in the frequency of alleles over time, creates a loss in genetic frequency (1 population)</p>
<p>Gene Flow – Movement of genes into/out of a population, occurs during migration, increases the genetic variation of a population (2 populations)</p>
<p>Sexual Selection (non-random mating) - The selection of traits that aren’t necessary for survival, but without them, the organism can’t reproduce and pass on its traits.</p>
		<u><b><p>Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium</p></b></u>
<p>When there is no change of allele frequencies over time.</p>
<p>This will happen if:</p>
<p>	Population is large</p>
<p>	Must be random mating</p>
<p>	No migration</p>
<p>	No mutations</p>
<p>	No natural selection</p>
<p>	All members of the population breed </p>
<p>	Same number of offspring</p>
<p>Formula:</p>
<p>p^2+2pq+q^2=1</p>
<p>p^2= genotype frequency of homozygous dominant individuals</p>
<p>2pq = genotype frequency of heterozygous individuals</p>
<p>q^2= genotype frequency of homozygous recessive individuals</p>
		<u><b><p>Patterns of Macroevolution</p></b></u>
<p>Speciation – Forming of a new species from a preexisting species, some sort of isolation must occur (will explain later) A species is defined as a group of organisms that can successfully interbreed and create fertile offspring The gene pool will gradually become different until the species can no longer interbreed and at that time they are considered.2 different species.</p>
<p>Extinction-The elimination of a species</p>
<p>There is mass extinction and gradual extinction Mass extinction happens when a catastrophic even ch</p>anges the environment. Gradual extinction happens at a slow rate due to changes in climate.</p>
<p>Gradualism – Slow, constant changes over a long period of time</p>
<p>Ex: Peppered moth becomes darker over time because of the industrial revolution </p>
<p>Punctuated equilibrium – Bursts of change followed by periods of stability</p>
<p>Ex: Changes in the mammal population in the Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras.</p>
<p>Divergent Evolution – A number of different species arise from one common ancestor,</p>
<p>Ex: A common ancestor of mammals led to monkeys, koalas, and bears </p>
<p>(Adaptive radiation – A type of divergent evolution occurring on a small scale over a shorter period of time)</p>
<p>Convergent evolution – When unrelated species evolve similar characteristics because they live in similar environments</p>
<p>Ex: Animals that can fly but aren’t all related</p>
<p>Coevolution – When two populations of organisms form a specialized relationship and thus change in response to each other</p>
<p>Ex: Flowers and insects that pollinate them</p>
<b><p>Isolation:</p></b>
<p>Reproductive Isolation: The inability of species to breed</p>
<p>Ex. An organisms can’t breed with others of its own species</p>
<p>Behavioral Isolation: An organism starts behaving differently, which causes it to be unable to mate with any other organisms of the same species.</p>
<p>Ex. A bird starts singing a different mating song. This causes it to have a hard time finding mates.</p>
<p>Geographic isolation:  The geography separates two groups of the same species and eventually they become different species.</p>
<p>Ex. Continental drift separates the continent of Australia causing the majority of marsupials to be stuck on it.</p>
<p>Temporal isolation: When two or more species reproduce at different times.</p>
<p>Ex. Different orchid species flower at different times to prevent hybridization.</p>
<u><b><p>EVIDENCE OF EVOLUTION</p></b></u>
<p>Evolution ties together evidence from these branches of science </p>
<p>Paleontology – Study of prehistoric life through the fossil record</p>
<p>Evidence: Fossils, transitional fossils, which link ancestral species to their descendants</p>
<p>Morphology – Study of the form of living things</p>
<p>3 structures provide evidence of evolution </p>
<p>Homologous structures which are similar structures that suggest common ancestry and results from divergent evolution.</p>
<p>Vestigial structures- Structures with little or no purpose that could be left over from an ancestor which provides evidence for divergent evolution. </p>
<p>Analogous structures- Similar structures evoked independently due to serving a similar purpose which comes from convergent evolution.</p>
<p>Biogeography – Study of the geographic distribution of plants and animals </p>
<p>Evidence: The distribution of organisms' lines up with what was being discovered about Pangea and stuffs</p>
<p>Embryology – Study of Embryo development </p>
<p>Evidence: Similarities in the embryos of vertebrates early in development suggests common ancestry among vertebrates</p>
<p>Biochemistry – Study of chemical processes in living things (Helps create phylogenic trees)</p>
<p>Evidence: Related species would have similar DNA sequences, pseudogenes (nonfunctional genes) provide evidence of divergent evolution</p>
<p>Microevolution allows people to witness evolution in their lifespan. </p>
<u><b><p>HUMAN STUFF:</p></b></u>
<p>Hominid is a term to describe modern and extinct Great Apes. These animals are bipedal, human like, and intelligent.</p>
<p>Humans share a common ancestor with other primates. Primates have flexible hands and feet, forward looking eyes, enlarged brains, and opposable thumbs.</p>
<p>Modern apes aren’t the same as humans. They aren’t bipedal, don’t make tools, and have a smaller brain case. <p>
<p>We share 98% of our DNA with chimpanzees.</p>
<p>Anthropologists study humans and past humans.</p>
<p>There are two main groups of primates: Prosimians and Anthropoids</p>
<p>Prosimians are the oldest group, are nocturnal, and consist of lemurs and lorises. </p>
<p>Anthropoids are humanlike primates and are divided into New World monkeys (live in trees and have prehensile tails), Old World monkeys (live mainly on the ground larger brains compared to New), and Hominoids. </p>
<p>Lucy was found in 1974 in Ethiopia. She was 3.2 million years old. Scientific name is Australopithecus afarensis. Four feet tall and was bipedal.</p>
<p>The Laetoli Footprints is 3.6 million years old.</p>
<p>Hominids include all species of human lineage. They walk upright, have long lower limbs, opposable thumbs, and relatively large brains. 2 important groups are Homo and Australopithecus.</p>
<p>Trends up to humans: smaller brow ridge, larger brain case, smaller jaw</p>
<p>Bipedal developed first, then usage of tools, then language development</p>

	<b><p>Ecological Organization:</p></b>
<p>1.	Organism: individual member of a species or a population</p>
<p>2.	Population: multiple organisms of the same species living together</p>
<p>3.	Community: multiple populations of different species living together</p>
<p>4.	Ecosystem: community plus all the abiotic factors in the environment</p>
<p>5.	Biome: multiple ecosystems that share similar characteristics but are in different parts of the planet</p>
<p>6.	Biosphere: the zone of life on Earth, encompassing all of Earth’s ecosystems</p>
	<b><u><p>Food Webs/Trophic Levels/Pathway of Energy:</p></u></b>
<p>1.	The Sun provides all the energy in an ecosystem</p>
<p>2.	Then producers' energy from the sunlight </p>
<p>3.	Primary Consumers eat the producer and obtain 1/10 of the energy</p>
<p>4.	Secondary Consumers eat the primary consumer for 1/100 of the original energy</p>
<p>5.	Tertiary Consumer eats secondary consumer and gets 1/1000 of original energy</p>
<p>Ex: Sun->Grass->Grasshopper->Shrew->Owl</p>
<p>The grass is the producer, the grasshopper is the primary consumer, the shrew is the secondary consumer, and the owl is the tertiary consumer</p>
<p>Living things are divided into 2 categories:</p>
<p>Producers – Make their own energy by capturing sunlight or using chemicals</p>
<p>Consumers-Consume other organisms for food</p>
<p>Types of consumers:</p>
<p>Herbivore- Only plants</p>
<p>Carnivore-Only meat</p>
<p>Omnivore: Plants and meat</p>
<p>Detritivores- Dead stuff</p>
<p>Decomposers- Organisms that break down dead stuff into component elements or simpler constituents</p>
<p>Food Webs:</p>
<p> Always point in the direction of the energy flow</p>
<p>Made up of multiple food chains</p>
<p>Shows complexity of interactions within an ecosystem</p>
<p>Energy Pyramid: </p>
<p>Diagram representing the amount of energy in each trophic level.</p>
<p>Shows the ten percent rule (each level has 10% of energy of the organism they consumed)</p>
<p>The ten percent rule is due to organisms using energy in everyday processes</p>
	<b><u><p>Water, Carbon, and Nitrogen Cycles:</p></u></b>
<b><p>Water Cycle: (ez stuff)</p></b>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/5WyX75z/Picture1.png" alt="Picture1" border="0"></p>
<p>Main parts:</p>
<p>Precipitation - When water falls to Earth as a liquid. (Ex. Rain or snow)</p>
<p>Infiltration – When some water seeps underground into the surface of the Earth into aquifers (which is a layer of permeable rock that can hold water)</p>
<p>Runoff – Water that didn’t get infiltrated runs along the surface and collects in lakes, rivers, or oceans.</p>
<p>Evaporation - The sun heats up liquid water into water vapor and it rises to the atmosphere</p>
<p>Transpiration – Water that evaporates off of plants</p>
<p>Condensation – Water vapor cools and becomes liquid water that bunches together to form clouds.</p>
<p>The effect of living organisms is that all organisms take in water for nutrient transport, chemical reactions, diffusion, and more. This also means they eliminate water through urine. All organisms release water after cellular respiration. Plants take in water to make sugar in photosynthesis. Human impact: </p>
<p>•	Deforestation affects transpiration</p>
<p>•	Building increases runoff and decreases infiltration</p>
<p>•	Pollution </p>
<p>•	Eutrophication is when a body of water becomes overly enriched causing excessive algae growth</p>
	<b><p>Carbon Cycle: </p></b>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/gV6nGv3/Picture2.png" alt="Picture2" border="0"></p>
<p>The carbon cycle goes through living and nonliving things. Unlike the water cycle, carbon changes chemical forms as it cycles.</p>
<p>•	CO2 in the atmosphere but C6H12O6 as glucose in plants</p>
<p>Main parts:</p>
<p>•	Photosynthesis: carbon dioxide is captured from the atmosphere and used to make sugar</p>
<p>•	Cellular Respiration: carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere as waste from metabolism</p>
<p>•	Consumption: one organism eats another for carbon</p>
<p>•	Decomposition: decomposers break down carbon from dead organisms, recycling it in the soil</p>
<p>•	Fossilization: converts carbon from once-living organisms into fossil fuels through intense heat and compression</p>
<p>•	Combustion: carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere from burning</p>
<p>Living Organisms- Decomposers break down dead materials and return nutrients while photosynthetic organisms remove CU2 from atmosphere and convert it to simple sugars and then animals, plants, and fungi all do cellular respiration to break down carbon rick molecules for energy. </p>
<p>Human impact:</p>
<p>Combustion is when wood or fossil fuels containing carbon are burned which causes major release of CO2 in atmosphere</p>
	<b><p>Nitrogen Cycle:</p></b>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/8s32Tdq/Picture3.png" alt="Picture3" border="0"></p>
	<u><p>Main Parts:</p></u>
<p>Nitrogen Fixation / Atmospheric Fixation – Bacteria (or lightning) in the soil or water convert nitrogen (from the air or water) into forms that plants can use</p>
<p>Consumption: one organism eats another and obtains the nitrogen in it.</p>
<p>Decomposition: decomposers, like bacteria, break down once-living organisms, returning nitrogen to the soil. </p>
<p>Ammonification: bacteria convert nitrogen from waste (urine and feces) into ammonia.</p>
<p>Nitrification: bacteria convert nitrogen in ammonia into nitrates and nitrites to be absorbed by plants in their roots.</p>
<p>	This is how nitrogen enters the food chain, and eventually reaches us</p>
<p>Denitrification: bacteria convert nitrogen in ammonia to N2 so it can go back into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Living Organisms impact: This is different than other cycles since no step is completed without living organisms. Bacteria is the most important since living organism since it converts nitrogen into different forms but Fungi and other decomposers also breakdown nitrogen rich waste and put it in the soil.</p>
<p>Human impact: Overuse of synthetic fertilizers adds too much nitrogen to the ecosystem creating imbalance. This causes eutrophication, which is where too much nitrogen in water leads to lots of algae growing, causing other organisms to die out.</p>
	<b><u><p>Populations:</p></u></b>
<p>Population Density: measures the number of individual organisms living in a defined space. </p>
<p>•	Birth (natality), immigration, death(mortality), and emigration all effect it</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/51CjkMX/Picture4.png" alt="Picture4" border="0"></p>
	<p>Population Dispersion: the spatial distribution of organisms in a population</p>
	<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7SBhbVk/Picture5.png" alt="Picture5" border="0"></p>
<p>Survivorship Curves: A graphic representation of mortality patterns. It shows the number of individuals in a population that can be expected to survive to any age. There are three types.</p>
<p>•	Type 1: Late loss</p>
<p>o	Heavy parental care</p>
<p>o	Ex. Humans</p>
<p>•	Type 2: Constant loss</p>
<p>o	Mortality unaffected by age</p>
<p>o	Ex. Some birds, rodents</p>
<p>•	Type 3: Early loss</p>
<p>o	Produce lots of offspring at once and many die right away</p>
<p>o	Ex. Fish, mosquitoes</p>
	<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZhZmxhg/Picture6.png" alt="Picture6" border="0"></p>
<p>There are two types of population growth. </p>
<p>1.	Exponential: Populations grow without limit like the human population</p>
<p>2.	Logistic- Population grows quickly at first but then levels out. The carrying capacity is the theoretical maximum population an environment could support.</p>
<p>Limiting factors are aspects of the environment that limit the size a population can reach. There are biotic and abiotic ones. There are density dependent factors that have a bigger effect on bigger populations and density independent which have the same effect no matter the density. </p>
	<b><p>Ocean Zones:</p></b>
<p>The ocean can be divided into zones. These zones can be determined by their distance from shoreline and water depths</p>
<p>•	Intertidal zone: between low and high tide</p>
<p>o	Organisms must tolerate a range of different conditions and must contempt with changes of temperature, amount of moisture, and solidity</p>
<p>•	Neritic zone: from intertidal zone to continental shelf</p>
<p>o	Few centimeters to 200 meters</p>
<p>o	Most ocean life lives in this zone</p>
<p>o	Has more biomass than any other zone</p>
<p>o	Represents less than 1/10 of the total ocean area</p>
<p>o	Contains 40x more biomass than the rest of the ocean</p>
<p>o	Lots of plankton</p>
<p>	Tiny free-floating organisms that live in the water and include both animals and protists</p>
<p>	Zooplankton: animal plankton</p>
<p>	Phytoplankton: Photosynthetic plankton which includes microscopic protists such as algae</p>
<p>•	Bathyal zone: from neritic zone to base of continental shelf</p>
<p>o	Ranges from 200 to 2000 meters</p>
<p>o	Water is turbid and murky due to the accumulation of silt</p>
<p>o	Fish adapted to live in the bathyal zone are adapted to high pressures</p>
<p>o	Burrowing animals thrive in this zone</p>
<p>•	Abyssal zone: lies below 2000 meters</p>
<p>o	Complete darkness</p>
<p>o	Deep sea vents support many organisms</p>
<p>o	The number of species found here is way smaller than the number found in the neritic zone</p>
<p>o	No light = no photosynthesis organisms</p></p>
<p>o	Chemosynthetic organisms</p>
<p>Coastal waters contain unique habitats</p>
<p>Coral reefs are found in warm waters within the tropical climate zone</p>
<p>•	Tropical climate zone</p>
<p>•	Great amount of biomass</p>
<p>•	Water temperature remains warm all year</p>
<p>•	A single coral reef may have 50 to 400 species of coral, along with hundreds of other species including fish, sponges, and sea urchins</p>
<p>•	Like the rain forest of the oceans</p>
<p>•	Biomass up to 1000x greater than the biomass in similar areas of the ocean that does not contain a reef</p>
<p>Kelp forests are found in cold, nutrient-rich waters</p>
<p>•	Large communities of seaweed</p>
<p>•	Great amounts of biomass</p>
<p>•	Found in waters like in California, Morro Bay (don’t ask why Mrs. Velez just used this analogy)</p>
<p>•	Kelp: type of seaweed</p>
<p>o	Grows from ocean floor to water’s surface</p>
<p>o	Sometimes extends to a height over 30 meters/about 100 feet</p>
<p>•	Area of high productivity that provides many more species ranging from tiny invertebrates to even large mammals such as sea lions</p>
<b><u><p>Relationships:</p></u></b>
<p>Organisms react due to the fact that there are limited resources.</p>
<p>Many organisms will share a habitat (a place where the organism lives)</p>
<p>There are 2 types of relationships</p>
<p>•	Predation- Happens when one animal kills and eats another for food. The predator is the one hunting and the prey is the one being killed for food. A predator prey graph shows how the prey and the predator respond to each other over time. As you can see, when the population of a prey goes up, the population of a predator does as well. A keystone species is a species that holds an ecosystem together and is critical for the survival of other species in an ecosystem. Predators are often keystone species.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1qWbzKh/Picture7.png" alt="Picture7" border="0"></p>
<p>•	Competition- A relationship where 2 or more organisms fight for the same limited resource. There is interspecific where it happens between two different species. (Think International) Then there is intraspecific which is happening in the same species. (Think intramural)</p>
<p>The competition exclusion principle says that no two organisms can occupy the same place at the same time without one of two things happening. </p>
<p>1.	The organisms are different, and one is more fit than the other</p>
<p>•	They are similar and they fight to see who will win. The loser finds a different niche. </p>
<u><b><p>Succession:</p></b></u>
<p>Ecological succession is a process of ecological change in an ecosystem where one community is replaced by another community.</p>
<p>Pioneer species are the first organisms to grow in the ecosystem during succession</p>
<p>Examples: weeds, mosses, lichens, grasses, etc...</p>
<p>Two types:</p>
<p>•	Primary Succession – formation of a brand-new ecosystem</p>
<p>o	(Baking cookies from scratch with new ingredients)</p>
<p>o	Results in a mature community</p>
<p>o	Occurs when a community forms in an area that has not been previously occupied (ex. Lava, ice, sand, exposed rock), occurs over a long period of time</p>
<p>o	Pioneer species are lichens and mosses. These organisms decompose rock and release nutrients to form a layer of soil, so more complex plants can grow in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>o	Once enough soil has been generated, small plants can grow. These plants further break down the rock, allowing more soil to be made. More soil = more nutrients retained</p>
<p>o	As new species of plant move in, animal species will start inhabiting the area. Organisms at this stage may hinder their own survival but pave the way for future organisms.</p>
<p>o	Eventually, a mature community results, in which there is little change in the composition of species. This is called the climax community and is the end!</p>
<p>•	Secondary Succession - Recovery of an old ecosystem</p>
<p>o	(Making pizza with pre-made dough)</p>
<p>o	Results in a mature community</p>
<p>o	Occurs when a previous ecosystem was destroyed and gets recovered by the soil still present (ex. Farming, drought, fire, hurricane, etc...)</p>
<p>o	Secondary succession occurs in an area that was previously occupied but was destroyed by a disturbance. Established communities are destroyed but soil is still intact therefore it takes less time than primary succession.</p>
<p>o	Pioneer species are usually weeds and grasses. These can grow quickly and proceed until a climax community</p>
<p>o	It isn’t always a bad thing; the new ecosystem could be better than the old one, could be a reformation of the old one.</p>
<p>Stable Ecosystem – One that remains relatively constant, with predictable changes</p>


<b><u><p>Human Impact:</p></u></b>
<p>We humans have impacted Earth a whole lot, mostly by destroying it though. Even though we have had huge technological advances, in the end all we have done is destroy our Earth. (that’s just my opinion ignore that if u want)</p>
<p>Sustainability: A balance between Earth’s resources, human needs, and the needs of other species.</p>
<p>Ecological (Carbon) Footprint: The amount of carbon emitted and its environmental impact.</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>Role of Technology:</p>
<p>	Technology contributes to air, water, and land pollution AND provides clean energy, waste management, and pollution cleanup. </p>
<p>		3 main types of technology currently influence sustainability </p>
<p>Agricultural Technology:</p>
<p>Goal: increase food productivity</p>
<p>	Pro:</p>
<p>		Contour farming</p>
<p>		Fertilizer</p>
<p>		Irrigation systems</p>
<p>		Farm machinery</p>
<p>	Cons:</p>
<p>Fertilizers = excess nitrogen in the soil which alters it</p>
<p>Farm machinery which runs on fossil fuels pollutes the atmosphere</p>
<p>Industrial Technology</p>
<p>Goal: increase manufacturing efficiency, transportation, and communication.</p>
<p>	Pros:</p>
<p>		Improved communication, faster transportation, and cheaper industries </p>
<p>	Cons:</p>
<p>	Creation of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) from foam packing material and refrigerant</p>
<p>		CFCs deplete the ozone layer which is what keeps the Earth warm at night. </p>
<p>	Burning of fossil fuels</p>
<p>		Acid rain lowers soil pH, leaches soil nutrients, and changes aquatic pH</p>
<p>Greenhouse effect: the normal warming when gases trap heat in the atmosphere</p>
<p>	Greenhouse gases = CO2, O2, CH4, and H¬2O</p>
<p>		Trap heat energy and maintain Earth’s temperature range</p>
<p>		Prevent heat from escaping the atmosphere so it stays trapped</p>
<p>The sheer amount of CO2 we have released is enough to be trapped by the ozone layer for a long time, and that means that them being trapped there will trap even more heat which is the cause of global warming</p>
<p>
Biodiversity: the total amount of variation on Earth</p>
<p>	High biodiversity reflects a healthy ecosystem </p>
<u><p>More Human Impacts:</p></u>
<p>Desertification – Spread of dry, unproductive landscapes. Basically, make desert bigger.</p>
<p>Deforestation – Cut tree down. This means less CO2 is going to be absorbed, while more CO2 is being released</p>
<p>Global Warming – More CO2 in the atmosphere leading to more of the sun's radiation being trapped on Earth.  This leads to higher temperatures or more specifically 2 degrees Fahrenheit every 22 years. </p>

	<p>NOTES:</p>
	<p>Chemical bonds: </p>
 

<p>Covalent bonds-Forms when atoms share a pair of electrons. They are strong but depend on how many electrons an atom has. Also called a peptide bond in amino acids.  </p>

<p>Hydrogen bonds- An attraction between slightly positive hydrogen atom and slightly negative oxygen or nitrogen atom. Typical covalent bonds are 20 times stronger than one hydrogen bond, but hydrogen bonds are strong in water molecules. Causes high specific heat, cohesion, and adhesion.  </p>

<p>Ionic bond-Forms through the electrical force between oppositely charged atoms </p>

<p>Metallic bonds: Bonds that form between metals. It creates a sea of electrons which is why metals easily conduct electricity and heat </p>

<p>Van der Waals force: Weakest force, causes water to form droplets </p>

 
<p>Sudan 3- lipids, </p>

<p>Lugol’s iodine- complex carbs </p>

<p>Biuret- protein </p>
